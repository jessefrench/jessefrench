### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jesse. A passionate, creative, and detail-oriented software engineer committed to developing responsive and accessible solutions for todayâ€™s modern problems. Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to challenge myself and work on projects that require critical analysis and creative problem-solving.

Like most of the world, the Covid-19 pandemic changed my normal. I went from being a touring musician to being grounded. During this time, I went back to school for network administration, took a JavaScript course, and discovered that I really enjoyed coding. Upon receiving my degree, I started learning web development in my free time. I realized it was the perfect way to blend being analytical and creative, and I fully invested myself in software engineering.

Iâ€™m familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, OOP, Git/GitHub, and Web Accessibility, but Iâ€™m always adding new skills to my repertoire. Iâ€™m also eager to meet other software engineers, so feel free to connect!
